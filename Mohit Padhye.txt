Hi Guys, this is a tech enthusiast currently studying in 8th sem ,NCE. I would like to thank GCA 
for organizing the Git and Github training.

Well talking about my experience , i was able to learn git more meaningfully and in a productive way even though I 
had some knowledge regrading it.Looking forward for more future events as well.This session 
helped me to achieve new heights and sharpen my skills.I would also like to thank Milan Thapa for such productive session.
Thank You All
