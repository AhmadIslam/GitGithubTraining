## Feedback

I would like to appreciate for your 3 days of the wonderful session on " __Git and GitHub__ " provided by Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy, from July 6 to July 8, 2020.

During this session, we got to learn about the differences between Git and GitHub, git workflow, installation, bash scripts, git technology (add, commit, pull, push, fetch, clone, fork) and there uses. Being an IT student this session is very fruitful and useful in our career. I must say this training session makes my knowledge more enhances and even makes us highly motivated.

I am really grateful to be part of this placement as a scholar, looking forward to attending this kind of productive class which boosts us to become more self-reliant, job holder, and entrepreneurs with the right soft and hard skills.

I would also like to thanks **genese cloud academy and Girls in tech** for providing us these kinds of classes which not only help us to improve but make our ability more strong and even  Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy.  and volunteer for your valuable time and effort.
