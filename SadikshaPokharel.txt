## 3-Days Learning Journey

--> The Git and Github training conducted by Genese Cloud Academy taught me about the 
basics of git commands and how to organize our projects as a Github repository. As an 
IT student, I can now start using Github as a platform to work on projects together with my colleagues.


The training session was informative, beginner-friendly, and productive as expected.

Moreover, The availability of the recorded copy of the session made it much easier for 
students like us to watch it later in case we missed the live session.

Thank you GCA for conducting this training session.
