It was a great experience taking this hard skill training provided by GCA and GirlsIn Tech.
I really enjoyed the 3days training.
Before I have heard about git and github but I didn't knew how to use it.
So this training taught me some bash scripts like mkdir,cd,rm,nano,pull,push,branch,etc.
Our trainer Milan Thapa Dai was so friendly while teaching us.He taught us in such an easy and understandable way.
I really enjoyed playing the game at the last of our session which also helped us to know how much we have learned from this training.
This training is going to help me alot in my coming future.
So atlast I would like to say I am very grateful for your wonderful contribution towards us.
