I have heard about github and always wanted to learn about it so that our project team can take benefits through it .During lockdown and learning about git and github through online has helped me very much .the game section at last was very beneficial couldn't win but that has helped me to revise all the topics we have covered in these three day training.I am overwelmed for giving me this oppurtunity to enhance my knowlegde through it.
