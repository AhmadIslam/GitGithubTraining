* Hello GCA Team, I am really excited to share my experience of learning git for past 3 days. I was using Git and Github before this course 
but only basics like add new file or changes, committing, pushing and pulling. After taking this course i can proudly say that i came to 
know more about Git and Github. I have heard about topics like branching, merging, sending pull request, assigning contributors and issues, 
reseting the pointer to HEAD ~1,2,3,.. but haven't use them on my own. Our instructor Mr. Milan Thapa have brillantly taught every topic 
very simply and effectively making everyone go with him which was quite impressive and helpful as many of the participant were begineer as 
well.

My expectation going forward was to atleast be able to contribute on open source projects on github which was met efficiently.

I have been following GCA's event from some time and i feel like they have been providing many useful webinars which are much effectively 
for students and tech enthusiast. Looking forward for more webinars and workshop. At last i want to thank entire GCA and GIT team with 
Mr. Milan Thapa for providing such an effective and wonderful session.
