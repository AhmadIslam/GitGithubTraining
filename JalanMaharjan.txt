The 3 days learning was an interesting session. I was very much fascinated by this code hosting platform. 
In these 3 days I learned about the basic commands of GIT and GITHUB platform. 
I also learned about the features of this hosting platform.

It is my first time that I am learning to use this platform. 
I had expected to learn the basics of GIT and GITHUB which was addressed in the session. 
The 3 days session was very fruitful to me.

I like the facilitation style of the trainer which caters all types of learners. 
I would love to join the advanced sessions for GIT and GITHUB in near future and grow my expertise accordingly. 
GCA is giving a good platform for the youths to enhance their professional skills. 
I would definitely look forward to attend more sessions in future. I wish the GCA team for great success.
