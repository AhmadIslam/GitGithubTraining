I am obliged towards Genese Cloud Academy and all the members for conducting this training session. During this hard time involving in the productive thing is the best way to keep oneself occupied. These three days Git and GitHub training has been very fruitful and have helped me to add value to my skill. I am not completely new to GitHub, I had been using GitHub to store projects but I didnâ€™t have much knowledge about a branch, merge, collaboration. So, after this training, I have much more knowledge about the different features of GitHub. 
I would like to express my immense gratitude to the trainer Mr. Milan Thapa for his invaluable guidance and being calm and composed throughout the training. I appreciate the effort he has put to make the training effective and explaining every information detailly in a possible way. I hope in days to come participants like me would get the opportunity to learn more from him.
Lastly, I am looking forward to other training conducted by Genese Cloud Academy. Thank you for making all the resources available online.
