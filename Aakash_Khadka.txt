I had used git before to store files but could not figure out how to control the versions of a project and I stored same project as multiple repository.
This session has helped me to experiment with features of git such as branching, fork etc. Now I can use version control to help me do projects.
All I want to suggest is that GCA could teach git with sample projects implementation.
