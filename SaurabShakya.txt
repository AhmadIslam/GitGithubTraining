Hello Everyone,

I am Saurab Shakya and I have learned a lot of things about git and git hub in this recent program.
Eventhough I have used Github in past for my college projects,I had no idea what it was about.
I have watched the video resources provided and have gained a lot of knolege about Git and GitHub.
The course was very effective as it provided with the necessary information from the basics and 
was able to cover many different topics in this hort duration of time.

I would like to thank the team GCA for giving us this opportunity for improvement and help for our carrer.
Mr.Milan Thapa as a trainer has completed the course and was able to interact and solve out all the 
problems faced by students. I hope for learning more of these skills in future.

Thank you.
Saurab Shakya
