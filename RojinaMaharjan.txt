Hello  , This is rojina Maharjan.
Talking about my experience in this 3 days training on git and github, it was quite productive and helpful. 
Even though I have been using Git and git Hub for quite a long time, I decided to go for this training for a quite reflection and learning additional knowledge.
i found this training very beginner friendly and was very interactive. I also got to learn some new terminology and techniques which now i could use on my own projects.
The course syllabus was also quite good. Covering  many topics in this short period of time being so interactive and beginner friendly was quite challenging, but i found this training very productive and anyone who joined this training must have learnt something new including me.

I would like to thank the team GCA for conducting such training for students like us.  
And I would also like to thank the trainer Milan Thapa for facillitating such productive session.
I hope there would be more such hard skills training in the near future.

Thank you,
Rojina Maharjan
