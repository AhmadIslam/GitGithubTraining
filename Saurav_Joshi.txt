Hi, I am Saurav Joshi.
It was a really a great opportunity to get along with GCA & GIT to be a part of this training.
All the training whether it be soft or hard skills I found all of them pretty useful.
Cracking an interview,getting a resume,cover letter, report writing to the git and github skills
all these skills are important skills that every student needs to get to kickstart there career,
sadly these kind of skills are not really provided by the universities and colleges that we go to and this causes many students like me
lost in the road of our career, but thanks to GCA and GIT students like me and I got the opportunity for a roadmap or lets say a street light to our career path.

The skills u shared to us are more then that I got from the institution I paid too.
Really loved the quality of contents you brought up to us with the presentation
and delivery, hope we get the similar quality and contents from GCA & GIT to
fill the gap by being the bridge between our student life and professional life.
THANK YOU!!!
