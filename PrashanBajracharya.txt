          Hello I am Prashan Bajracharya. I am an IT student so I had few
       knowledge about Git and Github before this session and after
       attending and completing session, I am glad because I learnt
       how software developers collaborate in developing a project 
       and overall how to use Bash terminal.
          I would like to thank GCA, Girls In Technology and specially
       Milan sir for teaching us in such an easy way. I feel like I got
       more out of this session than I had expected and am glad that I 
       attended this.
         The session was well designed that I have no complaint and the
       only feedback I can give is that Please keep conducting such 
       sessions in future and God bless you all.
