Hello Everyone, It's me Eklal Budhathoki. I'm a 7th-semester student at Trinity International College pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Information Technology.

Git and GitHub Training which was organized by GCA was extremely helpful and I got to learn new technology. The program was good. Our mentor Milan Thapa was very supportive and tried to make understand 
every little thing. 

Hope to see more sessions like this. :)
