During these past three days, this training has helped solidify my Git knowledge from the ground up.
I have been using Git and GitHub for sometime now and with this training, I was hoping that I get to delve into topics I didn't know before, which I did.
To name a few, the git history visualization tool and instructions on traversing git history were especially helpful.

Overall, I enjoyed these three days and hope to be a part of future training sessions on the pipeline of GCA.
Again, a big thanks to GCA and Girls in Tech.
