I think,  Git adn Github training provideid by GCA was very productive. I learnt some basic git bash commands and also how to use git and git hub in basic level. In my
opinion this training is very fruitful for undergradutes like me, as it be a huge help for me in future. I would like to thank all the trainners for providig this 
oppurtunity.
