I had a great learning session of 3 days, on the topic "Git and Github Training" that was provided by Genese Cloud Academy.
Mr. Milan Thapa was an excellent mentor. He guided us with full determination and patience. 
I am an IT student and I had expected a lot from this session. 
As expected, I learned new topics inside Git and Github and grabbed many ideas. 
I want to thank to the whole team of Genese Cloud Academy  for such a wonderful session.
I want to salute to your efforts.
Although during pandemic, you gave us your valuable time for conducting sessions like this.
I hope you will provide beautiful trainings like these in upcoming future too. Thank you !
